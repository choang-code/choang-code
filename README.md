# About

Hello! My name is Chuong Hoang. I am an aspiring business analyst with consulting experience.

During the last four years, I have had the opportunity to use my data analytics skills throughout a variety of industries including nonprofits and management consulting. While studying Business Economics and Digital Information Systems at University of California, Irvine, I joined on-campus organizations to give back to the community such as Students Consulting for Nonprofit Organizations (SCNO) at UCI. While consulting, I noticed that many organizations had data from multiple sources, making it time-consuming to provide comprehensive analytics for upcoming business decisions. 

As a result, I learned that being able to clean, convert, and parse data from multiple sources would become useful especially as a Corporate Engagement & Analytics Intern at Make-A-Wish. In the future, I hope to grow my data analytics skillsets as data becomes larger but not always easier to analyze.
